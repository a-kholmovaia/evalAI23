<h2>Criteria for Good Answers</h2>

<div class="criteria">

    <button class="accordion">Examples</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span class="emoji">‚úÖ</span> "The lecturer used clear, well-structured explanations to cover complex statistical concepts, making it easier to understand. For instance, the step-by-step breakdown of the regression analysis was particularly effective."</p>
        <p><span class="emoji">‚úÖ</span> "In the team project, communication was key. Our team leader organized weekly meetings that were well-structured, allowing each member to share progress and concerns effectively."</p>
        <p><span class="emoji">‚ùå</span> "The lecture was good. I liked the statistics stuff."</p>
        <p><span class="emoji">‚ùå</span> "Teamwork was fine. We did stuff together."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="criteria">
    <h3>üéØ Relevance</h3>
    <p>Detail: Responses should directly address the questionnaire item, focusing on the lecture or teaching methods.</p>
    <button class="accordion">Examples</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span class="emoji">‚úÖ</span> "The lecture's focus on statistical software application was highly relevant to our coursework, allowing us to directly apply what we learned in class to our assignments."</p>
        <p><span class="emoji">‚úÖ</span> "The question on how roles were distributed within our team is relevant, as it highlights our strategy of leveraging individual strengths for task allocation, which significantly improved our efficiency."</p>
        <p><span class="emoji">‚ùå</span> "I think the university needs more parking spaces. It's hard to find a spot before class."</p>
        <p><span class="emoji">‚ùå</span> "I think the cafeteria food could be better. It's not related, but it's important."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="criteria">
    <h3>ü§î Depth of Reflection</h3>
    <p>Detail: Reflective responses should show deep engagement with the material, demonstrating critical thinking.</p>
    <button class="accordion">Examples</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span class="emoji">‚úÖ</span> "The lecture prompted me to think critically about the ethical implications of statistical analysis in research, particularly in terms of data privacy and consent, which I hadn't considered deeply before."</p>
        <p><span class="emoji">‚úÖ</span> "Reflecting on our team dynamics, I realized the importance of active listening. When we encountered a conflict, it was the ability to genuinely understand each other's viewpoints that led to a constructive resolution."</p>
        <p><span class="emoji">‚ùå</span> "The lecture was long and had lots of numbers."</p>
        <p><span class="emoji">‚ùå</span> "We just did our parts. Not much else to say."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="criteria">
    <h3>üìå Specific Examples</h3>
    <p>Detail: Good responses tie feedback to specific instances from the lecture, offering clear, contextualized examples.</p>
    <button class="accordion">Examples</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span class="emoji">‚úÖ</span> "In response to the question about the clarity of statistical concepts presented, I appreciated the detailed breakdown of the 'Central Limit Theorem' in week 3's lecture, where the professor used the class's average quiz scores as a practical example to explain the concept."</p>
        <p><span class="emoji">‚úÖ</span> "When addressing the question on conflict resolution, I recall a specific instance where there was a disagreement on the project design. We resolved it by combining elements from each proposal, leading to a more innovative solution."</p>
        <p><span class="emoji">‚ùå</span> "The professor explained statistical concepts well."</p>
        <p><span class="emoji">‚ùå</span> "We had some disagreements, but it was nothing."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="criteria">
    <h3>üõ†Ô∏è Constructive Criticism</h3>

    <button class="accordion">Examples</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span class="emoji">‚úÖ</span> "While the lecture covered a lot of ground, some complex topics like hypothesis testing were rushed. It might be helpful to allocate more time to these areas or provide supplemental materials for further reading."</p>
        <p><span class="emoji">‚úÖ</span> "Although our team worked well on the whole, we could have benefited from a more structured approach to brainstorming sessions. Perhaps using a digital collaboration tool would help organize and record our ideas more effectively."</p>
        <p><span class="emoji">‚ùå</span> "I didn't get hypothesis testing. It was confusing."</p>
        <p><span class="emoji">‚ùå</span> "I think some team members were lazy but I'm not sure who."</p>
